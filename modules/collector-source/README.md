# OpenCost Data Sources - Collector

The OpenCost Collector is a data source implementation which provides OpenCost with the metrics and metadata required to calculate cost allocation. The collector is responsible for gathering data from various sources, such as Kubernetes, cloud providers, and other external systems, and transforming it into a format that can be consumed by the OpenCost API.
