# OpenCost Data Sources - Prometheus

The OpenCost Prometheus data source is an implementation which provides OpenCost with the metrics and metadata required to calculate cost allocation. Prometheus provides longer retention periods and more detailed metrics than the OpenCost Collector, which is useful for historical analysis and cost forecasting.
